# hello! 
I'm Liam, and I'm a webdev and programmer! I mostly like to mess around and make things for fun, but I have worked on a few professional projects.
## stuff I know how to use
 - HTML (surprising, right?)
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - Figma
 - Windows cmd
 - PHP
 - Some Batch
 (in that order)
## current working on
 - [PLAYHYDRA](https://github.com/liamhtml/playhydra)
 - [bana](https://github.com/liamhtml/idle-bana) üçå
 - [Pylon CLI](https://github.com/liamhtml/pylon-cli)
